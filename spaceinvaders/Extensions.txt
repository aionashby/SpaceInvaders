Extensions:
For our extensions we made multiple waves and we also put the score and number of lives on the screen.
We also made the background black.

New Wave:
For the new waves, if the player has won the game, and they still have lives left, the game will create
a new wave of aliens, but this time the speed of the aliens will double. In addition, the score and number of lives
left by the player will role over to the next wave.

We made this by adding parameters to our __init__ in waves (the parameters were score, lives, and speed). This way when
the wave started over we could control the score, lives, and the speed.

Player Score:
This extension displays the score of the player as the player shoots down aliens. The top most row is worth the
most points(15 points per alien), while the bottom most row is worth the least(5 points per alien). All the rows in the
middle are worth 10 points per alien. If there is only one row, the row is worth 5 points per alein and if there
are two rows the points are worth 5 points per alien for the bottom row and 15 points per alien for the top row.

We made this by making a method that first creates a list that holds the number of rows of aliens in the wave. Then
we found the max of the list and the min of the list. After, the method would check to see what row the alien shot was
in and then add points to the score based on the aliens row. The max row results in the lowest amount of points
(5 per alien), while the min row results in the highest amount of points(15 per alien)

Other:
Adding the lives to the screen we implemented similarly to how we implemented player score, except we only had the lives
change when the ship became none, until lives reached 0.
We also made the background black for contrast purposes.
